# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

We are assisting the data scientist at LendingClub to create a predictive model to predict credit risk for prospective clients for the peer-to-peer lending services company.

The following is an analysis of the balanced accuracy score and precision using six different algorithms trained to predict credit risk based on LendingClub credit data: 

* Oversampling using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* Undersampling using the ClusterCentroids algorithm, and SMOTEENN algorithm (over and undersampling).
* Two new machine learning models: BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, models that reduce bias to predict the credit risk. 

Recommendations will be made on which approach is the most effective!
